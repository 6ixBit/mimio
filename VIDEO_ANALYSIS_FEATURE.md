# Video Analysis Feature üé¨üîç

## Overview

The **Video Analysis** feature is the core differentiator for Mimio. It allows users to upload viral organic videos and automatically generate detailed, frame-by-frame Sora prompts to recreate them for their own brands, products, and use cases.

## üéØ Value Proposition

**Problem**: Brands see viral videos on TikTok/Instagram and want to recreate that style for their products, but don't know how to describe the exact camera movements, lighting, pacing, etc.

**Solution**: Upload the viral video ‚Üí Get a detailed Sora prompt ‚Üí Customize for your brand ‚Üí Generate AI video

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Video Upload

- **File Upload**: Users can upload video files directly (MP4, MOV, etc.)
- **URL Support** (coming soon): Paste TikTok, Instagram, YouTube links

### 2. AI Analysis Pipeline

```
Video Upload
     ‚Üì
Frame Extraction (12 key frames)
     ‚Üì
GPT-4 Vision Analysis (each frame)
     ‚Üì
Scene Grouping & Summarization
     ‚Üì
Detailed Sora Prompt Generation
```

### 3. Analysis Output

For each scene, we extract:

- **Description**: What's happening
- **Camera**: Angles, movements, shot types
- **Lighting**: Setup, direction, quality, color temp
- **Action**: Specific movements and actions
- **Composition**: Framing, visual balance
- **Colors**: Dominant colors, grading style
- **Mood**: Emotional tone

### 4. Customization

Users can:

- Replace product names
- Add brand identity
- Modify specific instructions
- Edit the raw prompt directly

### 5. Recreation

One-click button to:

- Pre-fill the Sora creation form
- Generate the video
- Download and use

frames = extract_key_frames(video_path, max_frames=12)
```

### GPT-4 Vision Analysis

```python
# Analyze each frame with detailed prompts
analysis = analyze_frame(
    frame_path=frame.path,
    timestamp=frame.timestamp,
    context="Describe for Sora recreation"
)
```

### Scene Grouping

```python
# Group nearby frames into coherent scenes
scenes = group_frames_into_scenes(
    frame_analyses,
    scene_threshold=3.0  # seconds
)
```

### Prompt Generation

```python
# Generate detailed second-by-second Sora prompt
sora_prompt = generate_sora_prompt(
    scene_summaries,
    overall_style="Professional commercial quality"
)
```

## üìù Example Output

### Input Video

```
8-second viral product unboxing video
```

### Generated Prompt

```
A professional product showcase video, 8 seconds total.

SCENE 1 (0-3s): Close-up shot of a sleek modern product centered on a pure white background. Camera slowly dollies in while rotating 360 degrees around the product. Soft key light from top-right creates gentle shadows, rim light adds definition to edges. Product rotates clockwise, its surface gleaming with highlights. Cinematography style: commercial product photography, shallow depth of field, pristine and premium feel.

SCENE 2 (3-6s): Cut to medium overhead shot of hands carefully unboxing the product. Natural daylight streams from a nearby window creating warm, inviting tones. Hands move deliberately, revealing the product with care. Camera maintains steady overhead angle. Lighting: soft natural light, golden hour quality, authentic and relatable atmosphere.

SCENE 3 (6-8s): Rapid montage of extreme macro shots highlighting product features. Camera quickly cuts between close-ups of buttons, texture, materials. High contrast lighting creates dramatic shadows. Each detail is sharp and prominent. Cinematography: commercial macro photography, crisp focus, dynamic and energetic pacing.

Overall aesthetic: Premium commercial quality, modern and aspirational, fast-paced energy, vibrant yet sophisticated color grading.

### Customized for Brand

Add "Brand: GreenTech. Emphasize sustainability and eco-friendly messaging"

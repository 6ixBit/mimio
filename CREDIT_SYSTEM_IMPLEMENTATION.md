## Credit Costs

### OpenAI Sora API Pricing

- **sora-2** (720x1280 or 1280x720): **$0.10/second**
- **sora-2-pro** (720x1280 or 1280x720): $0.30/second ‚ùå Not offered (unprofitable)
- **sora-2-pro** (1024x1792 or 1792x1024): $0.50/second ‚ùå Not offered (unprofitable)

### Our Credit System (Sora-2 720p Only)

- **1 credit = 1 second** of Sora-2 720p video
- 4 seconds = 4 credits ($0.40 API cost)
- 8 seconds = 8 credits ($0.80 API cost)
- 12 seconds = 12 credits ($1.20 API cost)

### Pricing Breakdown & Margins

- **Basic ($19.99)**: 80 credits = ~10√ó 8sec videos
  - Max API cost: $8.00
  - Margin: **60%** ‚úÖ
- **Pro ($44.99)**: 200 credits = ~25√ó 8sec videos
  - Max API cost: $20.00
  - Margin: **56%** ‚úÖ
- **Premium ($89.99)**: 450 credits = ~56√ó 8sec videos
  - Max API cost: $45.00
  - Margin: **50%** ‚úÖ

### Why No Sora-2-Pro?

At 3-5x the cost per second, Sora-2-Pro would make our margins negative:

- 8sec video on sora-2-pro (720p): $2.40 API cost
- 8sec video on sora-2-pro (1024p): $4.00 API cost
- On our Basic plan: Would use 80 credits for only 3-8 videos ‚ùå

## Usage

### To Run Migration

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i supabase/migrations/010_credit_system.sql
```

### Credit Service Examples

```typescript
import {
  getUserCredits,
  deductCredits,
  hasEnoughCredits,
} from "@/lib/credit-service";

// Check balance
const balance = await getUserCredits(userId);

// Check if enough credits
const check = await hasEnoughCredits(userId, 8); // 8 second video

// Deduct credits
const result = await deductCredits(
  userId,
  8,
  "Video generation: 8 seconds",
  videoId
);
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run migration in Supabase
2. ‚úÖ Update Stripe products with credit metadata
3. ‚è≥ Add credit display to UI

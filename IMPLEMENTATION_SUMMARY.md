# ✅ Batch Video Creation - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What Was Built

I've professionally implemented **complete batch video creation** functionality for Mimio, with three distinct modes:

### 1. **Single Video**

- Enhanced version of your existing functionality
- Clean UI with all options
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Template pre-fill support

### 2. **Variations** (NEW)

- Generate 1-3 variations of the same prompt
- Perfect for A/B testing
- All variations tracked simultaneously

### 3. **Batch Creation** (NEW)

- Create up to 3 completely different videos
- Each with unique prompts and settings
- Dynamic form (add/remove videos)
- Parallel tracking
